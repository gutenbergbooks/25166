<h1>WHAT THE LEFT HAND &hellip; WAS DOING<br />

<span class='sf75'>By DARRELL T. LANGART</span><br />

<span class='sf50'>Illustrated by Freas</span></h1>

<div class="blockquot i" style='margin-top:2em; margin-bottom:2em;'>
There is no lie so totally convincing as something the other fellow
already knows-for-sure is the truth. And no cover-story so
convincing&hellip;</div>

<p>The building itself was unprepossessive enough. It was an old-fashioned,
six-floor, brick structure that had, over the years, served first as a
private home, then as an apartment building, and finally as the
headquarters for the organization it presently housed.</p>

<p>It stood among others of its kind in a lower-middle-class district of
Arlington, Virginia, within howitzer range of the capitol of the United
States, and even closer to the Pentagon. The main door was five steps up
from the sidewalk, and the steps were flanked by curving balustrades of
ornamental ironwork. The entrance itself was closed by a double door
with glass panes, beyond which could be seen a small foyer. On both
doors, an identical message was blocked out in neat gold letters: <i>The
Society For Mystical and Metaphysical Research, Inc.</i></p>

<p>It is possible that no more nearly perfect cover, no more misleading
front for a secret organization ever existed in the history of man. It
possessed two qualities which most other cover-up titles do not have.
One, it was so obviously crackpot that no one paid any attention to it
except crackpots, and, two, it was perfectly, literally true.</p>

<p>Spencer Candron had seen the building so often that the functional
beauty of the whole setup no longer impressed him as it had several
years before. Just as a professional actor is not impressed by being
allowed backstage, or as a multimillionaire considers expensive luxuries
as commonplace, so Spencer Candron thought of nothing more than his own
personal work as he climbed the five steps and pushed open the
glass-paned doors.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, his matter-of-fact attitude was caused partially by the
analogical resemblance between himself and the organization. Physically,
Candron, too, was unprepossessing. He was a shade less than five eight,
and his weight fluctuated between a hundred and forty and a hundred and
forty-five, depending on the season and his state of mind. His face
consisted of a well-formed snub nose, a pair of introspective gray eyes,
a rather wide, thin-lipped mouth that tended to smile even when relaxed,
a high, smooth forehead, and a firm cleft chin, plus the rest of the
normal equipment that normally goes to make up a face. The skin was
slightly tanned, but it was the tan of a man who goes to the beach on
summer weekends, not that of an outdoorsman. His hands were strong and
wide and rather large; the palms were uncalloused and the fingernails
were clean and neatly trimmed. His hair was straight and light brown,
with a pronounced widow's peak, and he wore it combed back and rather
long to conceal the fact that a thin spot had appeared on the top rear
of his scalp. His clothing was conservative and a little out of style,
having been bought in 1981, and thus three years past being up-to-date.</p>

<p>Physically, then, Spencer Candron, was a fine analog of the Society. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
looked unimportant. On the outside, he was just another average man
whom no one would bother to look twice at.</p>

<p>The analogy between himself and the S.M.M.R. was completed by the fact
that his interior resources were vastly greater than anything that
showed on the outside.</p>

<p>The doors swung shut behind him, and he walked into the foyer, then
turned left into the receptionist's office. The woman behind the desk
smiled her eager smile and said, &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Candron!"</p>

<p>Candron smiled back. He liked the woman, in spite of her semifanatic
overeagerness, which made her every declarative sentence seem to end
with an exclamation point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morning, Mrs. Jesser,&rdquo; he said, pausing at the desk for a
moment. &ldquo;How have things been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Jesser was a stout matron in her early forties who would have been
perfectly happy to work for the Society for nothing, as a hobby. That
she was paid a reasonable salary made her job almost heaven for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just <i>fine</i>, Mr. Candron!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just
<i>fine</i>!&rdquo; Then her voice lowered, and her face took on a serious,
half conspiratorial expression. &ldquo;Do you know what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Candron, imitating her manner. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have a gentleman &hellip; he came in yesterday &hellip; a
<i>very</i> nice man &hellip; and very intelligent, too. And, you know
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candron shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Jesser's face took on the self-pleased look of one who has
important inside knowledge to impart. &ldquo;He has actual photographs &hellip;
three-D, full-color <i>pho</i>tographs &hellip; of the con<i>trol</i> room of a flying
saucer! And one of the Saucerites, too!"</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Candron's expression was that of a man who was
both impressed and interested. &ldquo;What did Mr. Balfour say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Jesser looked rather miffed. &ldquo;I
don't really <i>know</i>! But the gentleman is supposed to be back
to<i>mor</i>row! With some <i>more</i> pictures!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Candron. &ldquo;Well. That's really fine. I
hope he has something. Is Mr. Taggert in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mr. Candron! He said you should go on up!&rdquo; She
waved a plump hand toward the stairway. It made Mrs. Jesser happy to
think that she was the sole controller of the only way, except for the
fire escape, that anyone could get to the upper floors of the building.
And as long as she thought that, among other things, she was useful to
the Society. Someone had to handle the crackpots and lunatic-fringe
fanatics that came to the Society, and one of their own kind could do
the job better than anyone else. As long as Mrs. Jesser and Mr. Balfour
were on duty, the Society's camouflage would remain intact.</p>

<p>Spencer Candron gave Mrs. Jesser a friendly gesture with one hand and
then headed up the stairs. He would rather not have bothered to take the
stairway all the way up to the fifth floor, but Mrs. Jesser had sharp
ears, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and she might wonder why his foot-steps were not heard all the way up.
Nothing&mdash;but <i>nothing</i>&mdash;must ever be done to make Mrs. Jesser
wonder about anything that went on here.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>The door to Brian Taggert's office was open when Candron finally reached
the fifth floor. Taggert, of course, was not only expecting him, but had
long been aware of his approach.</p>

<p>Candron went in, closed the door, and said, &ldquo;Hi, Brian,&rdquo; to
the dark-haired, dark-eyed, hawk-nosed man who was sprawled on the couch
that stood against one corner of the room. There was a desk at the other
rear corner, but Brian Taggert wasn't a desk man. He looked like a
heavy-weight boxer, but he preferred relaxation to exercise.</p>

<p>But he did take his feet from the couch and lift himself to a sitting
position as Candron entered. And, at the same time, the one resemblance
between Taggert and Candron manifested itself&mdash;a warm, truly human
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spence,&rdquo; he said warmly, &ldquo;you look as though you were
bored. Want a job?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Candron, &ldquo;but I'll take it. Who do I
kill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody, unless you absolutely have to,&rdquo; said Taggert.</p>

<p>Spencer Candron understood. The one thing that characterized the real
members of The Society for Mystical and Metaphysical Research&mdash;not
the "front&rdquo; members, like Balfour and Mrs. Jesser, not the
hundreds of "honorable&rdquo; members who constituted the crackpot
portion of the membership, but the real core of the group&mdash;the
thing that characterized them could be summed up in one word:
<i>understanding</i>. Without that one essential property, no human mind can
be completely free. Unless a human mind is capable of understanding the
only forces that can be pitted against it&mdash;the forces of other
human minds&mdash;that mind cannot avail itself of the power that lies
within it.</p>

<p>Of course, it is elementary that such understanding must also apply to
oneself. Understanding of self must come before understanding of others.
<i>Total</i> understanding is not necessary&mdash;indeed, utter totality is
very likely impossible to any human mind. But the greater the
understanding, the freer the mind, and, at a point which might be called
the &ldquo;critical point,&rdquo; certain abilities inherent in the
individual human mind become controllable. A change, not only in
quantity, but in quality, occurs.</p>

<p>A cube of ice in a glass of water at zero degrees Celsius exhibits
certain properties and performs certain actions at its surface. Some of
the molecules drift away, to become one with the liquid. Other molecules
from the liquid become attached to the crystalline ice. But, the ice
cube remains essentially an entity. Over a period of time, it may change
slowly, since dissolution takes place faster than crystallization at the
corners of the cube. Eventually, the cube will become a sphere, or
something very closely approximating it. But the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
change is slow, and, once it reaches that state, the situation becomes
static.</p>

<p>But, if you add heat, more and more and more, the ice cube will change,
not only its shape, but its state. What it was previously capable of
doing only slightly and impermanently, it can now do completely. The
critical point has been passed.</p>

<p>Roughly&mdash;for the analog itself is rough&mdash;the same things
occurs in the human mind. The psionic abilities of the human mind are,
to a greater or lesser degree, there to begin with, just as an ice cube
has the <i>ability</i> to melt if the proper conditions are met with.</p>

<p>The analogy hardly extends beyond that. Unlike an ice cube, the human
mind is capable of changing the forces outside it&mdash;as if the ice
could seek out its own heat in order to melt. And, too, human minds vary
in their inherent ability to absorb understanding. Some do so easily,
others do so only in spotty areas, still others cannot reach the
critical point before they break. And still others can never really
understand at all.</p>

<p>No one who had not reached his own critical point could become a
&ldquo;core&rdquo; member of the S.M.M.R. It was not snobbery on their
part; they understood other human beings too well to be snobbish. It was
more as though a Society for Expert Mountain Climbers met each year on
the peak of Mount Everest&mdash;anyone who can get up there to attend
the meeting is automatically a member.</p>

<p>Spencer Candron sat down in a nearby chair. &ldquo;All right, so I
refrain from doing any more damage than I have to. What's the
objective?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taggert put his palms on his muscular thighs and leaned forward.
&ldquo;James Ch&rsquo;ien is still alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candron had not been expecting the statement, but he felt no surprise.
His mind merely adjusted to the new data. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s still in
China, then,&rdquo; he said. It was not a question, but a statement of a
deduction. &ldquo;The whole thing was a phony. The death, the body, the
funeral. What about the executions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were real,&rdquo; Taggert said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what
happened as closely as we can tell:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien was kidnaped on July 10th, the second day of the
conference in Peiping, at some time between two and three in the
morning. He was replaced by a double, whose name we don&rsquo;t know.
It&rsquo;s unimportant, anyway. The double was as perfect as the Chinese
surgeons could make him. He was probably not aware that he was slated to
die; it is more likely that he was hypnotized and misled. At any rate,
he took Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s place on the rostrum to speak that
afternoon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man who shot him, and the man who threw the flame bomb, were
probably as equally deluded as to what they were doing as the double
was. They did a perfect job, though. The impersonator was dead, and his
skin was charred and blistered clear up to the chest&mdash;no
fingerprints.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
&ldquo;The men were tried, convicted, and executed. The Chinese
government sent us abject apologies. The double&rsquo;s body was shipped
back to the United States with full honors, but by the time it reached
here, the eye-cone patterns had deteriorated to the point where they
couldn&rsquo;t be identified any more than the fingerprints could. And
there were half a hundred reputable scientists of a dozen friendly
nations who were eye-witnesses to the killing and who are all absolutely
certain that it was James Ch&rsquo;ien who died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candron nodded. &ldquo;So, while the whole world was mourning the fact
that one of Earth&rsquo;s greatest physicists has died, he was being
held captive in the most secret and secure prison that the Red Chinese
government could put him in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taggert nodded. &ldquo;And your job will be to get him out,&rdquo; he
said softly.</p>

<p>Candron said nothing for a moment, as he thought the problem out.
Taggert said nothing to interrupt him.</p>

<p>Neither of them worried about being overheard or spied upon. Besides
being equipped with hush devices and blanketing equipment, the building
was guarded by Reeves and Donahue, whose combined senses of perception
could pick up any activity for miles around which might be inimical to
the Society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much backing do we get from the Federal Government?&rdquo;
Candron asked at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can swing the cover-up afterwards all the way,&rdquo; Taggert
told him firmly. &ldquo;We can arrange transportation back. That is, the
Federal Government can. But getting over there and getting Ch&rsquo;ien
out of durance vile is strictly up to the Society. Senator Kerotski and
Secretary Gonzales are giving us every opportunity they can, but
there&rsquo;s no use approaching the President until after we&rsquo;ve
proven our case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candron gestured his understanding. The President of the United States
was a shrewd, able, just, and ethical human being&mdash;but he was not
yet a member of the Society, and perhaps would never be. As a
consequence it was still impossible to convince him that the S.M.M.R.
knew what it was talking about&mdash;and that applied to nearly ninety
per cent of the Federal and State officials of the nation.</p>

<p>Only a very few knew that the Society was an <i>ex officio</i> branch of the
government itself. Not until the rescue of James Ch&rsquo;ien was an
accomplished fact, not until there was physical, logical proof that the
man was still alive would the government take official action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the outline?&rdquo; Candron wanted to know.</p>

<p>Taggert outlined the proposed course of action rapidly. When he was
finished, Spencer Candron simply said, &ldquo;All right. I can take care
of my end of it.&rdquo; He stood up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you,
Brian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Brian Taggert lay back down on the couch, propped up his feet, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
winked at Candron. &ldquo;Watch and check, Spence.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img-15a.png" width="600" height="264" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Candron went back down the stairs. Mrs. Jesser smiled up at him as he
entered the reception room. &ldquo;Well! That didn&rsquo;t take long!
Are you leaving, Mr. Candron?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the wall clock. &ldquo;Grab and
run, you know. I&rsquo;ll see you soon, Mrs. Jesser. Be an angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out the door again and headed down the street. Mrs. Jesser had
been right; it hadn&rsquo;t taken him long. He&rsquo;d been in
Taggert&rsquo;s office a little over one minute, and less than half a
dozen actual words had been spoken. The rest of the conversation had
been on a subtler level, one which was almost completely nonverbal. Not
that Spencer Candron was a telepath; if he had been, it wouldn&rsquo;t
have been necessary for him to come to the headquarters building.
Candron&rsquo;s talents simply didn&rsquo;t lie along that line. His
ability to probe the minds of normal human beings was spotty and
unreliable at best. But when two human beings understand each other at
the level that existed between members of the Society, there is no need
for longwinded discourses.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/img-15b.png" width="300" height="441" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>The big stratoliner slowed rapidly as it approached the Peiping
People&rsquo;s Airfield. The pilot, a big-boned Britisher who had two
jobs to do at once, watched the airspeed indicator. As the needle
dropped, he came in on a conventional landing lane, aiming <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
for the huge field below. Then, as the needle reached a certain point,
just above the landing minimum, he closed his eyes for a fraction of a
second and thought, with all the mental power at his command: <i>NOW!</i></p>

<p>For a large part of a second, nothing happened, but the pilot knew his
message had been received.</p>

<p>Then a red gleam came into being on the control board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; said the co-pilot.</p>

<p>The pilot swore. &ldquo;I <i>told</i> &rsquo;em that door was weak!
We&rsquo;ve ripped the luggage door off her hinges. Feel her
shake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The co-pilot looked grim. &ldquo;Good thing it happened now instead of
in mid-flight. At that speed, we&rsquo;d been torn apart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Blown</i> to bits, you mean,&rdquo; said the pilot.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bring her in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By that time, Spencer Candron was a long way below the ship, falling
like a stone, a big suitcase clutched tightly in his arms. He knew that
the Chinese radar was watching the jetliner, and that it had undoubtedly
picked up two objects dropping from the craft&mdash;the door and one
other. Candron had caught the pilot&rsquo;s mental signal&mdash;anything
that powerful could hardly be missed&mdash;and had opened the door and
leaped.</p>

<p>But those things didn&rsquo;t matter now. Without a parachute, he had
flung himself from the plane toward the earth below, and his only
thought was his loathing, his repugnance, for that too, too solid ground
beneath.</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t hate it. That would be deadly, for hate implies as much
attraction as love&mdash;the attraction of destruction. Fear, too, was
out of the question; there must be no such relationship as that between
the threatened and the threatener. Only loathing could save him. The
earth beneath was utterly repulsive to him.</p>

<p>And he slowed.</p>

<p>His mind would not accept contact with the ground, and his body was
forced to follow suit. He slowed.</p>

<p>Minutes later, he was drifting fifty feet above the surface, his
altitude held steady by the emotional force of his mind. Not until then
did he release the big suitcase he had been holding. He heard it thump
as it hit, breaking open and scattering clothing around it.</p>

<p>In the distance, he could hear the faint moan of a siren. The Chinese
radar had picked up two falling objects. And they would find two: one
door and one suitcase, both of which could be accounted for by the
&ldquo;accident.&rdquo; They would know that no parachute had opened;
hence, if they found no body, they would be certain that no human being
could have dropped from the plane.</p>

<p>The only thing remaining now was to get into the city itself. In the
darkness, it was a little difficult to tell exactly where he was, but
the lights of Peiping weren&rsquo;t far away, and a breeze was carrying him
toward it. He wanted to be in just the right place before he set foot on
the ground.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
By morning, he would be just another one of the city&rsquo;s millions.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>Morning came three hours later. The sun came up quietly, as if its sole
purpose in life were to make a liar out of Kipling. The venerable old
Chinese gentleman who strolled quietly down Dragon Street looked as
though he were merely out for a placid walk for his morning
constitutional. His clothing was that of a middle-class office worker,
but his dignified manner, his wrinkled brown face, his calm brown eyes,
and his white hair brought respectful looks from the other passers-by on
the Street of the Dragon. Not even the thirty-five years of Communism,
which had transformed agrarian China into an industrial and
technological nation that ranked with the best, had destroyed the
ancient Chinese respect for age.</p>

<p>That respect was what Spencer Candron relied on to help him get his job
done. Obvious wealth would have given him respect, too, as would the
trappings of power; he could have posed as an Honorable Director or a
People&rsquo;s Advocate. But that would have brought unwelcome attention as
well as respect. His disguise would never stand up under careful
examination, and trying to pass himself off as an important citizen
might bring on just such an examination. But an old man had both respect
and anonymity.</p>

<p>Candron had no difficulty in playing the part. he had known many elderly
chinese, and he understood them well. even the emotional control of the
oriental was simple to simulate; candron knew what &ldquo;emotional
control&rdquo; <i>really</i> meant.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t control an automobile by throwing the transmission out
of gear and letting the engine run wild. Suppressing an emotion is not
controlling it, in the fullest sense. &ldquo;Control&rdquo; implies
guidance and use.</p>

<p>Peiping contained nearly three million people in the city itself, and
another three million in the suburbs; there was little chance that the
People&rsquo;s Police would single out one venerable oldster to
question, but Candron wanted an escape route just in case they did. He
kept walking until he found the neighborhood he wanted, then he kept his
eyes open for a small hotel. He didn&rsquo;t want one that was too
expensive, but, on the other hand, he didn&rsquo;t want one so cheap
that the help would be untrustworthy.</p>

<p>He found one that suited his purpose, but he didn&rsquo;t want to go in
immediately. There was one more thing to do. He waited until the shops
were open, and then went in search of second-hand luggage. He had enough
money in his pockets to buy more brand-new expensive luggage than a man
could carry, but he didn&rsquo;t want luggage that looked either
expensive or new. When he finally found what he wanted, he went in
search of clothing, buying a piece at a time, here and there, in widely
scattered shops. Some of it was new, some of it was secondhand, all of
it fit both the body and the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
personality of the old man he was supposed to be. Finally, he went to
the hotel.</p>

<p>The clerk was a chubby, blandly happy, youngish man who bowed his head
as Candron approached. There was still the flavor of the old politeness
in his speech, although the flowery beauty of half a century before had
disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, venerable sir; may I be of some assistance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candron kept the old usages. &ldquo;This old one would be greatly honored if
your excellent hostelry could find a small corner for the rest of his
unworthy body,&rdquo; he said in excellent Cantonese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is possible, aged one, that this miserable hovel may provide
some space, unsuited though it may be to your honored presence,&rdquo;
said the clerk, reverting as best he could to the language of a
generation before. &ldquo;For how many people would you require
accommodations?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my humble self only,&rdquo; Candron said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can, I think, be done,&rdquo; said the clerk, giving him a
pleasant smile. Then his face took on an expression of contrition.
&ldquo;I hope, venerable one, that you will not think this miserable
creature too bold if he asks for your papers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Candron, taking a billfold from his
inside coat pocket. &ldquo;Such is the law, and the law of the People of
China is to be always respected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened the billfold and spread the papers for the clerk&rsquo;s
inspection. They were all there&mdash;identification, travel papers,
everything. The clerk looked them over and jotted down the numbers in
the register book on the desk, then turned the book around. &ldquo;Your
chop, venerable one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;chop&rdquo; was a small stamp bearing the ideograph which
indicated the name Candron was using. Illiteracy still ran high in China
because of the difficulty in memorizing the tens of thousands of
ideographs which made up the written language, so each man carried a
chop to imprint his name. Officially, China used the alphabet, spelling
out the Chinese words phonetically&mdash;and, significantly, they had
chosen the Latin alphabet of the Western nations rather than the
Cyrillic of the Soviets. But old usages die hard.</p>

<p>Candron imprinted the ideograph on the page, then, beside it, he wrote
&ldquo;Ying Lee&rdquo; in Latin characters.</p>

<p>The clerk&rsquo;s respect for this old man went up a degree. He had
expected to have to put down the Latin characters himself. &ldquo;Our
humble establishment is honored by your esteemed presence, Mr.
Ying,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For how long will it be your pleasure to
bestow this honor upon us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor business, unimportant though it is, will require it least
one week; at the most, ten days.&rdquo; Candron said, knowing full well
that twenty-four hours would be his maximum, if everything went well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It pains me to ask for money in advance from so honorable a gentleman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
as yourself,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;but such are the rules. It
will be seven and a half yuan per day, or fifty yuan per week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candron put five ten-yuan notes on the counter. Since the readjustment
of the Chinese monetary system, the yuan had regained a great deal of
its value.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>A young man who doubled as bellhop and elevator operator took Candron up
to the third floor. Candron tipped him generously, but not
extravagantly, and then proceeded to unpack his suitcase. He hung the
suits in the closet and put the shirts in the clothes chest. By the time
he was through, it looked as though Ying Lee was prepared to stay for a
considerable length of time.</p>

<p>Then he checked his escape routes, and found two that were satisfactory.
Neither led downward to the ground floor, but upward, to the roof. The
hotel was eight stories high, higher than any of the nearby buildings.
No one would expect him to go up.</p>

<p>Then he gave his attention to the room itself. He went over it
carefully, running his fingers gently over the walls and the furniture,
noticing every detail with his eyes. He examined the chairs, the low
bed, the floor&mdash;everything.</p>

<p>He was not searching for spy devices. He didn&rsquo;t care whether there
were any there or not. He wanted to know that room. To know it, become
familiar with it, make it a part of him.</p>

<p>Had there been any spy devices, they would have noticed nothing unusual.
There was only an old man there, walking slowly around the room,
muttering to himself as though he were thinking over something important
or, perhaps, merely reminiscing on the past, mentally chewing over his
memories.</p>

<p>He did not peer, or poke, or prod. He did not appear to be looking for
anything. He picked up a small, cheap vase and looked at it as though it
were an old friend; he rubbed his hand over the small writing desk, as
though he had written many things in that familiar place; he sat down in
a chair and leaned back in it and caressed the armrests with his palms
as though it were an honored seat in his own home. And, finally, he
undressed, put on his nightclothes, and lay down on the bed, staring at
the ceiling with a soft smile on his face. After ten minutes or so, his
eyes closed and remained that way for three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Unusual? No. An old man must have his rest. There is nothing unusual
about an old man taking a short nap.</p>

<p>When he got up again, Spencer Candron was thoroughly familiar with the
room. It was home, and he loved it.</p>

<p>Nightfall found the honorable Mr. Ying a long way from his hotel. He
had, as his papers had said, gone to do business with a certain Mr. Yee,
had haggled over the price of certain goods, and had been unsuccessful
in establishing a mutual price. Mr. Yee <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was later to be able to prove to the People&rsquo;s Police that he had
done no business whatever with Mr. Ying, and had had no notion whatever
that Mr. Ying&rsquo;s business connections in Nanking were totally
nonexistent.</p>

<p>But, on that afternoon, Mr. Ying had left Mr. Yee with the impression
that he would return the next day with, perhaps, a more amenable
attitude toward Mr. Yee&rsquo;s prices. Then Mr. Ying Lee had gone to a
restaurant for his evening meal.</p>

<p>He had eaten quietly by himself, reading the evening edition of the
Peiping <i>Truth</i> as he ate his leisurely meal. Although many of the
younger people had taken up the use of the knife and fork, the venerable
Mr. Ying clung to the chopsticks of an earlier day, plied expertly
between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He was not the only
elderly man in the place who did so.</p>

<p>Having finished his meal and his newspaper in peace, Mr. Ying Lee
strolled out into the gathering dusk. By the time utter darkness had
come, and the widely-spaced street lamps of the city had come alive, the
elderly Mr. Ying Lee was within half a mile of the most important group
of buildings in China.</p>

<p>The Peiping Explosion, back in the sixties, had almost started World War
Three. An atomic blast had leveled a hundred square miles of the city
and started fires that had taken weeks to extinguish. Soviet Russia had
roared in its great bear voice that the Western Powers had attacked, and
was apparently on the verge of coming to the defense of its Asian
comrade when the Chinese government had said irritatedly that there had
been no attack, that traitorous and counterrevolutionary Chinese agents
of Formosa had sabotaged an atomic plant, nothing more, and that the
honorable comrades of Russia would be wise not to set off anything that
would destroy civilization. The Russian Bear grumbled and sheathed its
claws.</p>

<p>The vast intelligence system of the United States had reported that (A)
the explosion had been caused by carelessness, not sabotage, but the
Chinese had had to save face, and (B) the Soviet Union had no intention
of actually starting an atomic war at that time. If she had, she would
have shot first and made excuses afterwards. But she <i>had</i> hoped to make
good propaganda usage of the blast.</p>

<p>The Peiping Explosion had caused widespread death and destruction, yes;
but it had also ended up being the fastest slum-clearance project on
record. The rebuilding had taken somewhat more time than the clearing
had taken, but the results had been a new Peiping&mdash;a modern city in
every respect. And nowhere else on Earth was there one hundred square
miles of <i>completely</i> modern city. Alteration takes longer than starting
from scratch if the techniques are available; there isn&rsquo;t so much
dead wood to clear away.</p>

<p>In the middle of the city, the Chinese government had built its
equivalent of the Kremlin&mdash;nearly a third <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of a square mile of ultra-modern buildings designed to house every
function of the Communist Government of China. It had taken slave labor
to do the job, but the job had been done.</p>

<p>A little more than half a mile on a side, the area was surrounded by a
wall that had been designed after the Great Wall of China. It stood
twenty-five feet high and looked very quaint and picturesque.</p>

<p>And somewhere inside it James Ch&rsquo;ien, American-born physicist, was
being held prisoner. Spencer Candron, alias Mr. Ying Lee, had to get him
out.</p>

<p>Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien was important. The government of the United States knew
he was important, but they did not yet know <i>how</i> important he was.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>Man had already reached the Moon and returned. The Martian expedition
had landed safely, but had not yet returned. No one had heard from the
Venusian expedition, and it was presumed lost. But the Moon was being
jointly claimed by Russian and American suits at the United Nations,
while the United Nations itself was trying to establish a claim. The
Martian expedition was American, but a Russian ship was due to land in
two months. The lost Venusian expedition had been Russian, and the
United States was ready to send a ship there.</p>

<p>After nearly forty years, the Cold War was still going on, but now the
scale had expanded from the global to the interplanetary.</p>

<p>And now, up-and-coming China, defying the Western Powers and arrogantly
ignoring her Soviet allies, had decided to get into the race late and
win it if she could.</p>

<p>And she very likely could, if she could exploit the abilities of James
Ch&rsquo;ien to the fullest. If Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien could finish his work,
travel to the stars would no longer be a wild-eyed idea; if he could
finish, spatial velocities would no longer be limited to the confines of
the rocket, nor even to the confines of the velocity of light. Man could
go to the stars.</p>

<p>The United States Federal Government knew&mdash;or, at least, the most
responsible officers of that government knew&mdash;that
Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s equations led to interstellar travel, just as
Einstein&rsquo;s equations had led to atomic energy. Normally, the
United States would never have allowed Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien to attend the
International Physicists Conference in Peiping. But diplomacy has its
rules, too.</p>

<p>Ch&rsquo;ien had published his preliminary work&mdash;a series of highly
abstruse and very controversial equations&mdash;back in &rsquo;80. The
paper had appeared in a journal that was circulated only in the United
States and was not read by the majority of mathematical physicists. Like
the work of Dr. Fred Hoyle, thirty years before, it had been laughed at
by the majority of the men in the field. Unlike Hoyle&rsquo;s work, it
had never received any publicity. Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s paper had
remained buried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
In &rsquo;81, Ch&rsquo;ien had realized the importance of his work,
having carried it further. He had reported his findings to the proper
authorities of the United States Government, and had convinced that
particular branch of the government that his work had useful validity.
But it was too late to cover up the hints that he had already published.</p>

<p>Dr. James Ch&rsquo;ien was a friendly, gregarious man. He liked to go to
conventions and discuss his work with his colleagues. He was, in
addition, a man who would never let anything go once he had got hold of
it, unless he was convinced that he was up a blind alley. And, as far as
Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien was concerned, that took a devil of a lot of
convincing.</p>

<p>The United States government was, therefore, faced with a dilemma. If
they let Ch&rsquo;ien go to the International Conferences, there was the
chance that he would be forced, in some way, to divulge secrets that
were vital to the national defense of the United States. On the other
hand, if they forbade him to go, the Communist governments would suspect
that Ch&rsquo;ien knew something important, and they would check back on
his previous work and find his publications of 1980. If they did, and
realized the importance of that paper, they might be able to solve the
secret of the interstellar drive.</p>

<p>The United States government had figuratively flipped a coin, and the
result was that Ch&rsquo;ien was allowed to come and go as he pleased,
as though he were nothing more than just another government physicist.</p>

<p>And now he was in the hands of China.</p>

<p>How much did the Chinese know? Not much, evidently; otherwise they would
never have bothered to go to the trouble of kidnaping Dr. James
Ch&rsquo;ien and covering the kidnaping so elaborately. They
<i>suspected</i>, yes: but they couldn&rsquo;t <i>know</i>. They knew that the
earlier papers meant something, but they didn&rsquo;t know what&mdash;so
they had abducted Ch&rsquo;ien in the hope that he would tell them.</p>

<p>James Ch&rsquo;ien had been in their hands now for two months. How much
information had they extracted by now? Personally, Spencer Candron felt
that they had got nothing. You can force a man to work; you can force
him to tell the truth. But you can <i>not</i> force a man to create against
his will.</p>

<p>Still, even a man&rsquo;s will can be broken, given enough time. If Dr.
Ch&rsquo;ien weren&rsquo;t rescued soon&hellip;</p>

<p><i>Tonight</i>, Candron thought with determination. <i>I&rsquo;ll get
Ch&rsquo;ien tonight.</i> That was what the S.M.M.R. had sent him to do.
And that&rsquo;s what he would&mdash;<i>must</i>&mdash;do.</p>

<p>Ahead of him loomed the walls of the Palace of the Great Chinese
People&rsquo;s Government. Getting past them and into the inner court
was an act that was discouraged as much as possible by the Special
Police guard which had charge of those walls. They were brilliantly
lighted and heavily guarded. If Candron tried to levitate himself over,
he&rsquo;d most likely be shot down in midair. They might be baffled
afterwards, when <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
they tried to figure out how he had come to be flying around up there,
but that wouldn&rsquo;t help Candron any.</p>

<p>Candron had a better method.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>When the automobile carrying the People&rsquo;s Minister of Finance, the
Honorable Chou Lung, went through the Gate of the Dog to enter the inner
court of the Palace, none of the four men inside it had any notion that
they were carrying an unwanted guest. How could they? The car was a
small one; its low, streamlined body carried only four people, and there
was no luggage compartment, since the powerful little vehicle was
designed only for maneuvering in a crowded city or for fast, short trips
to nearby towns. There was simply no room for another passenger, and
both the man in the car and the guards who passed it through were so
well aware of that fact that they didn&rsquo;t even bother to think
about it. It never occurred to them that a slight, elderly-looking
gentleman might be hanging beneath the car, floating a few inches off
the ground, holding on with his fingertips, and allowing the car to pull
him along as it moved on into the Palace of the Great Chinese
People&rsquo;s Government.</p>

<p>Getting into the subterranean cell where Dr. James Ch&rsquo;ien was
being held was a different kind of problem. Candron knew the interior of
the Palace by map only, and the map he had studied had been admittedly
inadequate. It took him nearly an hour to get to the right place. Twice,
he avoided a patrolling guard by taking to the air and concealing
himself in the darkness of an overhead balcony. Several other times, he
met men in civilian clothing walking along the narrow walks, and he
merely nodded at them. He looked too old and too well-dressed to be
dangerous.</p>

<p>The principle that made it easy was the fact that no one expects a lone
man to break into a heavily guarded prison.</p>

<p>After he had located the building where James Ch&rsquo;ien was held, he
went high-flying. The building itself was one which contained the living
quarters of several high-ranking officers of the People&rsquo;s
Government. Candron knew he would be conspicuous if he tried to climb up
the side of the building from the outside, but he managed to get into
the second floor without being observed. Then he headed for the elevator
shafts.</p>

<p>It took him several minutes to jimmy open the elevator door. His mind
was sensitive enough to sense the nearness of others, so there was no
chance of his being caught red-handed. When he got the door open, he
stepped into the shaft, brought his loathing for the bottom into the
fore, and floated up to the top floor. From there it was a simple matter
to get to the roof, drop down the side, and enter the open window of an
officer&rsquo;s apartment.</p>

<p>He entered a lighted window rather than a darkened one. He wanted to
know what he was getting into. He had his gun ready, just in case,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
but there was no sign of anyone in the room he entered. A quick search
showed that the other two rooms were also empty. His mind had told him
that there was no one awake in the apartment, but a sleeping man&rsquo;s
mind, filled with dimmed, chaotic thoughts, blended into the background
and might easily be missed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/img-24.png" width="500" height="495" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Then Spencer Candron used the telephone, punching the first of the two
code numbers he had been given. A connection was made to the room where
a twenty-four-hour guard kept watch over James Ch&rsquo;ien via
television pickups hidden in the walls of his prison apartment in the
basement.</p>

<p>Candron had listened to recordings of one man&rsquo;s voice for hours,
getting the exact inflection, accent, and usage. Now, he made use of
that practice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is General Soong,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;We are sending a Dr. Wan down
to persuade the guest. We will want recordings of all that takes place.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the voice at the other end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Wan will be there within ten minutes, so be alert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. All will be done to your satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; said Candron. He smiled as he hung up. Then he
punched another secret number. This one connected him with the guards
outside Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s apartment. As General Soong, he warned them
of the coming of Dr. Wan. Then he went to the window, stepped out, and
headed for the roof again.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>There was no danger that the calls would be suspected. Those two phones
could not be contacted except from inside the Palace, and not even then
unless the number was known.</p>

<p>Again he dropped down Elevator Shaft Three. Only Number One was
operating this late in the evening, so there was no fear of meeting it
coming up. He dropped lightly to the roof of the car, where it stood
empty in the basement, opened the escape hatch in the roof, dropped
inside, opened the door, and emerged into the first basement. Then he
started down the stairs to the subbasement.</p>

<p>The guards were not the least suspicious, apparently. Candron wished he
were an honest-to-God telepath, so he could be absolutely sure. The
officer at the end of the corridor that led to Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s
apartment was a full captain, a tough-looking, swarthy Mongol with dark,
hard eyes. &ldquo;You are Dr. Wan?&rdquo; he asked in a guttural
baritone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Candron said. This was no place for traditional
politeness. &ldquo;Did not General Soong call you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did, indeed, doctor. But I assumed you would be
carrying&mdash;&rdquo; He gestured, as though not quite sure what to
say.</p>

<p>Candron smiled blandly. &ldquo;Ah. You were expecting the little black
bag, is it not so? No, my good captain; I am a psychologist, not a
medical doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s face cleared. &ldquo;So. The persuasion is to be of
the more subtle type.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed. Only thus can we be assured of his co-operation. One
cannot force the creative mind to create; it must be cajoled. Could one
have forced the great K&rsquo;ung Fu-tse to become a philosopher at the
point of a sword?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Will you permit me to
search you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The affable Dr. Wan emptied his pockets, then permitted the search. The
captain casually looked at the identification in the wallet. It was,
naturally, in perfect order for Dr. Wan. The identification of Ying Lee
had been destroyed hours ago, since it was of no further value.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These things must be left here until you come out, doctor,&rdquo;
the captain said. &ldquo;You may pick them up when you leave.&rdquo; He
gestured at the pack of cigarettes. &ldquo;You will be given cigarettes
by the interior guard. Such are my orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Candron said calmly. &ldquo;And now, may I see
the patient?&rdquo; He had wanted to keep those cigarettes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Now he would have to find a substitute.</p>

<p>The captain unlocked the heavy door. At the far end, two more guards
sat, complacently playing cards, while a third stood at a door a few
yards away. A television screen imbedded in the door was connected to an
interior camera which showed the room within.</p>

<p>The corridor door was closed and locked behind Candron as he walked
toward the three interior guards. They were three more big, tough
Mongols, all wearing the insignia of lieutenants. This was not a
prisoner who could be entrusted to the care of common soldiers; the
secret was too important to allow the <i>hoi polloi</i> in on it. They
carried no weapons; the three of them could easily take care of
Ch&rsquo;ien if he tried anything foolish, and besides, it kept weapons
out of Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s reach. There were other methods of taking
care of the prisoner if the guards were inadequate.</p>

<p>The two officers who were playing cards looked up, acknowledged Dr.
Wan&rsquo;s presence, and went back to their game. The third, after
glancing at the screen, opened the door to James Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s
apartment. Spencer Candron stepped inside.</p>

<p>It was because of those few seconds&mdash;the time during which that
door was open&mdash;that Candron had called the monitors who watched
Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s apartment. Otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t have
bothered. He needed fifteen seconds in which to act, and he
couldn&rsquo;t do it with that door open. If the monitors had given an
alarm in these critical seconds&hellip;</p>

<p>But they hadn&rsquo;t, and they wouldn&rsquo;t. Not yet.</p>

<p>The man who was sitting in the easy-chair on the opposite side of the
room looked up as Candron entered.</p>

<p>James Ch&rsquo;ien (B.S., M.S., M.I.T., Ph. D., U.C.L.A.) was a young
man, barely past thirty. His tanned face no longer wore the affable
smile that Candron had seen in photographs, and the jet-black eyes
beneath the well-formed brows were cold instead of friendly, but the
intelligence behind the face still came through.</p>

<p>As the door was relocked behind him, Candron said, in Cantonese:
&ldquo;This unworthy one hopes that the excellent doctor is well. Permit
me to introduce my unworthy self: I am Dr. Wan Feng.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien put the book he was reading in his lap. He looked at
the ceiling in exasperation, then back at Candron. &ldquo;All
right,&rdquo; he said in English, &ldquo;so you don&rsquo;t believe me.
But I&rsquo;ll repeat it again in the hope that I can get it through
your skulls.&rdquo; It was obvious that he was addressing, not only his
visitor, but anyone else who might be listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not speak Chinese,&rdquo; he said, emphasizing each word
separately. &ldquo;I can say &lsquo;Good morning&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Good-by&rsquo;, and that&rsquo;s about it. I <i>do</i> wish I could
say &lsquo;drop dead,&rsquo; but that&rsquo;s a luxury I can&rsquo;t
indulge. If you can speak English, then go ahead; if not, quit wasting
my time and yours. Not,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that it won&rsquo;t be a
waste of time anyway, but at least it will relieve the monotony.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Candron knew that Ch&rsquo;ien was only partially telling the truth. The
physicist spoke the language badly, but he understood it fairly well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry, doctor,&rdquo; Candron said in English, &ldquo;I guess I
forgot myself. I am Dr. Wan Feng.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s expression didn&rsquo;t change, but he waved to a
nearby chair. &ldquo;Sit down, Dr. Feng, and tell me what propaganda
line you&rsquo;ve come to deliver now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candron smiled and shook his head slowly. &ldquo;That was unworthy of
you, Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien. Even though you have succumbed to the Western
habit of putting the family name last, you are perfectly aware that
&lsquo;Wan,&rsquo; not &lsquo;Feng,&rsquo; is my family name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The physicist didn&rsquo;t turn a hair. &ldquo;Force of habit, Dr. Wan.
Or, rather, a little retaliation. I was called &lsquo;Dakta
Chamis&rsquo; for two days, and even those who could pronounce the name
properly insisted on &lsquo;Dr. James.&rsquo; But I forget myself. I am
supposed to be the host here. Do sit down and tell me why I should give
myself over to Communist China just because my grandfather was born here
back in the days when China was a republic.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>Spencer Candron knew that time was running out, but he had to force
Ch&rsquo;ien into the right position before he could act. He wished
again that he had been able to keep the cigarettes. Ch&rsquo;ien was a
moderately heavy smoker, and one of those drugged cigarettes would have
come in handy now. As it was, he had to handle it differently. And that
meant a different approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that was
deliberately too smooth, &ldquo;I will not sit down, thank you. I would
prefer that you stand up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The physicist&rsquo;s face became a frozen mask. &ldquo;I see that the
doctorate you claim is not for studies in the field of physics.
You&rsquo;re not here to worm things out of me by discussing my work
talking shop. What is it, <i>Doctor</i> Wan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>"I am a psychologist.&rdquo; Candron said. He knew that the monitors watching
the screens and listening to the conversation were recording everything.
He knew that they shouldn't be suspicious yet. But if the real General
Soong should decide to check on what his important guest was doing....</p>

<p>"A psychologist,&rdquo; Ch'ien repeated in a monotone. &ldquo;I see."</p>

<p>"Yes. Now, will you stand, or do I have to ask the guards to lift you to
your feet?"</p>

<p>James Ch'ien recognized the inevitable, so he stood. But there was a
wary expression in his black eyes. He was not a tall man; he stood
nearly an inch shorter than Candron himself.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to fear, Dr. Ch'ien,&rdquo; Candron said smoothly. &ldquo;I merely
wish to test a few of your reactions. We do not wish to hurt you.&rdquo; He
put his hands on the other man's shoulders, and positioned him. &ldquo;There,"
he said. &ldquo;Now. Look to the left."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hypnosis, eh?&rdquo; Ch'ien said with a grim smile. &ldquo;All right. Go ahead.&rdquo; He
looked to his left.</p>

<p>"Not with your head,&rdquo; Candron said calmly. &ldquo;Face me and look to the left
with your eyes."</p>

<p>Ch&rsquo;ien did so, saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have
to use drugs after all, Dr. Wan. I will not be hypnotized.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no intention of hypnotizing you. Now look to the
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ch&rsquo;ien obeyed.</p>

<p>Candron&rsquo;s right hand was at his side, and his left hand was toying
with a button on his coat. &ldquo;Now up,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Dr. James Ch&rsquo;ien rolled his eyeballs upward.</p>

<p>Candron had already taken a deep breath. Now he acted. His right hand
balled into a fist and arced upwards in a crashing uppercut to
Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s jaw. At almost the same time, he jerked the button
off his coat, cracked it with his fingers along the special fissure
line, and threw it to the floor.</p>

<p>As the little bomb spewed forth unbelievable amounts of ultra-finely
divided carbon in a dense black cloud of smoke, Candron threw both arms
around the collapsing physicist, ignoring the pain in the knuckles of
his right hand. The smoke cloud billowed around them, darkening the room
and obscuring the view from the monitor screens that were watching them.
Candron knew that the guards were acting now; he knew that the big
Mongols outside were already inserting the key in the door and inserting
their nose plugs; he knew that the men in the monitor room had hit an
alarm button and had already begun to flood the room with sleep gas. But
he paid no attention to these things.</p>

<p>Instead, he became homesick.</p>

<p>Home. It was a little place he knew and loved. He could no longer stand
the alien environment around him; it was repugnant, repelling. All he
could think of was a little room, a familiar room, a beloved room. He
knew the cracks in its ceiling, the feel of the varnish on the homely
little desk, the touch of the worn carpet against his feet, the very
smell of the air itself. And he loved them and longed for them with all
the emotional power that was in him.</p>

<p>And suddenly the darkness of the smoke-filled prison apartment was gone.</p>

<p>Spencer Candron stood in the middle of the little hotel room he had
rented early that morning. In his arms, he held the unconscious figure
of Dr. James Ch&rsquo;ien.</p>

<p>He gasped for breath, then, with an effort, he stooped, allowed the limp
body of the physicist to collapse over his shoulder, and stood straight
again, carrying the man like a sack of potatoes. He went to the door of
the room and opened it carefully. The hall was empty. Quickly, he moved
outside, closing the door behind him, and headed toward the stair. This
time, he dared not trust the elevator shaft. The hotel only boasted one
elevator, and it might be used at any time. Instead, he allowed his
dislike for the stair treads <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to adjust his weight to a few pounds, and then ran up them two at a
time.</p>

<p>On the roof of the hotel, he adjusted his emotional state once more, and
he and his sleeping burden drifted off into the night, toward the sea.</p>

<p>No mind is infinitely flexible, infinitely malleable, infinitely capable
of taking punishment, just as no material substance, however
constructed, is capable of absorbing the energies brought to bear
against it indefinitely.</p>

<p>A man can hate with a virulent hatred, but unless time is allowed to
dull and soothe that hatred, the mind holding it will become corroded
and cease to function properly, just as a machine of the finest steel
will become corroded and begin to fail if it is drenched with acid or
exposed to the violence of an oxidizing atmosphere.</p>

<p>The human mind can insulate itself, for a time, against the destructive
effects of any emotion, be it hatred, greed, despondency, contentment,
happiness, pleasure, anger, fear, lust, boredom, euphoria,
determination, or any other of the myriads of &ldquo;ills&rdquo; that
man&rsquo;s mind&mdash;and thus his flesh&mdash;is heir to. As long as a
mind is capable of changing from one to another, to rotate its crops, so
to speak, the insulation will remain effective, and the mind will remain
undamaged. But any single emotional element, held for too long, will
break down the resistance of the natural insulation and begin to damage
the mind.</p>

<p>Even that least virulent of emotions, love, can destroy. The hot,
passionate love between new lovers must be modified or it will kill.
Only when its many facets can be shifted around, now one and now the
other coming into play, can love be endured for any great length of
time.</p>

<p>Possibly the greatest difference between the sane and the unsane is that
the sane know when to release a destructive force before it does more
than minimal damage; to modify or eliminate an emotional condition
before it becomes a deadly compulsion; to replace one set of concepts
with another when it becomes necessary to do so; to recognize that point
when the mind must change its outlook or die. To stop the erosion, in
other words, before it becomes so great that it cannot be repaired.</p>

<p>For the human mind cannot contain any emotion, no matter how weak or how
fleeting, without change. And the point at which that change ceases to
be <i>con</i>structive and becomes, instead, <i>de</i>structive&mdash;<i>that</i> is the
ultimate point beyond which no human mind can go without forcing a
change&mdash;<i>any</i> change&mdash;in itself.</p>

<p>Spencer Candron knew that. To overuse the psionic powers of the human
mind is as dangerous as overusing morphine or alcohol. There are limits
to mental powers, even as there are limits to physical powers.</p>

<p><i>Psychokinesis</i> is defined as the ability of a human mind to move, no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
matter how slightly, a physical object by means of psionic application
alone. In theory, then, one could move planets, stars, even whole
galaxies by thought alone. But, in physical terms, the limit is easily
seen. Physically, it would be theoretically possible to destroy the sun
if one had enough atomic energy available, but that would require the
energy of another sun&mdash;or more. And, at that point, the Law of
Diminishing Returns comes into operation. If you don&rsquo;t want a bomb
to explode, but the only way to destroy that bomb is by blowing it up
with another bomb of equal power, where is the gain?</p>

<p>And if the total mental power required to move a planet is greater than
any single human mind can endure&mdash;or even greater than the total mental
endurance of a thousand planetsfull of minds, is there any gain?</p>

<p>There is not, and can never be, a system without limits, and the human
mind is a system which obeys that law.</p>

<p>None the less, Spencer Candron kept his mind on flight, on repulsion, on
movement, as long as he could. He was perfectly willing to destroy his
own mind for a purpose, but he had no intention of destroying it
uselessly. He didn&rsquo;t know how long he kept moving eastward; he had
no way of knowing how much distance he had covered nor how long it had
taken him. But, somewhere out over the smoothly undulating surface of
the Pacific, he realized that he was approaching his limit. And, a few
seconds later, he detected the presence of men beneath the sea.</p>

<p>He knew they were due to rise an hour before dawn, but he had no idea
how long that would be. He had lost all track of time. He had been
keeping his mind on controlling his altitude and motion, and, at the
same time, been careful to see whether Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien came out of his
unconscious state. Twice more he had had to strike the physicist to keep
him out cold, and he didn&rsquo;t want to do it again.</p>

<p>So, when he sensed the presence of the American submarine beneath the
waves, he sank gratefully into the water, changing the erosive power of
the emotion that had carried him so far, and relaxing into the simple
physical routine of keeping both himself and Ch&rsquo;ien afloat.</p>

<p>By the time the submarine surfaced a dozen yards away, Spencer Candron
was both physically and mentally exhausted. He yelled at the top of his
lungs, and then held on to consciousness just long enough to be rescued.</p>

<hr class='minor' />

<p>&ldquo;The official story,&rdquo; said Senator Kerotski, &ldquo;is that
an impostor had taken Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s place before he ever left
the United States&mdash;&rdquo; He grinned. &ldquo;At least, the
substitution took place before the delegates reached China. So the
&lsquo;assassination&rsquo; was really no assassination at all.
Ch&rsquo;ien was kidnaped here, and a double put in his place in
Peiping. That absolves both us and the Chinese Government of any
complicity. We save face for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
them, and they save face for us. Since he turned up here, in the States,
it&rsquo;s obvious that he couldn&rsquo;t have been in China.&rdquo; He
chuckled, but there was no mirth in it. &ldquo;So the cold war still
continues. We know what they did, and&mdash;in a way&mdash;they know
what we did. But not how we did it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senator looked at the other two men who were with him on the fifth
floor office of the <i>Society for Mystical and Metaphysical Research</i>.
Taggert was relaxing on his couch, and Spencer Candron, just out of the
hospital, looked rather pale as he sat in the big, soft chair that
Taggert had provided.</p>

<p>The senator looked at Candron. &ldquo;The thing I don&rsquo;t understand
is, why was it necessary to knock out Ch&rsquo;ien? He&rsquo;ll have a
sore jaw for weeks. Why didn&rsquo;t you just tell him who you were and
what you were up to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Candron glanced at Taggert, but Taggert just grinned and nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t allow that,&rdquo; said Candron, looking at
Senator Kerotski. &ldquo;Dr. James Ch&rsquo;ien has too much of a
logical, scientific mind for that. We&rsquo;d have ruined him if
he&rsquo;d seen me in action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senator looked a little surprised. &ldquo;Why? We&rsquo;ve convinced
other scientists that they were mistaken in their observations. Why not
Ch&rsquo;ien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ch&rsquo;ien is too good a scientist,&rdquo; Candron said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the type who would refuse to believe something he
saw simply because it didn&rsquo;t agree with his theories. Ch&rsquo;ien
is one of those dangerous in-betweens. He&rsquo;s too brilliant to be
allowed to go to waste, and, at the same time, too rigid to change his
manner of thinking. If he had seen me teleport or levitate, he
wouldn&rsquo;t reject it&mdash;he&rsquo;d try to explain it. And that
would have effectively ruined him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruined him?&rdquo; The senator looked a little puzzled.</p>

<p>Taggert raised his heavy head from the couch. &ldquo;Sure, Leo,&rdquo;
he said to the senator. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see? We <i>need</i>
Ch&rsquo;ien on this interstellar project. He absolutely <i>must</i> dope out
the answer somehow, and no one else can do it as quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the previous information,&rdquo; the senator said, &ldquo;we
would have been able to continue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Taggert said, sitting up. &ldquo;Has anyone been
able to dope out Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem without Fermat? No. So why
ruin Ch&rsquo;ien?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would ruin him,&rdquo; Candron broke in, before the senator
could speak. &ldquo;If he saw, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that
levitation and teleportation were possible, he would have accepted his
own senses as usable data on definite phenomena. But, limited as he is
by his scientific outlook, he would have tried to evolve a scientific
theory to explain what he saw. What else could a scientist <i>do</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Senator Kerotski nodded, and his nod said: &ldquo;I see. He would have
diverted his attention from the field of the interstellar drive to the
field of psionics. And he would have wasted years trying to explain an
inherently <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
nonlogical area of knowledge by logical means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Candron said. &ldquo;We would have set
him off on a wild goose chase, trying to solve the problems of psionics
by the scientific, the logical, method. We would have presented him with
an unsolvable problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taggert patted his knees. &ldquo;We would have given him a problem that
he could not solve with the methodology at hand. It would be as though
we had proved to an ancient Greek philosopher that the cube <i>could</i> be
doubled, and then allowed him to waste his life trying to do it with a
straight-edge and compass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know Ch&rsquo;ien&rsquo;s psychological pattern,&rdquo;
Candron continued. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not capable of admitting that there
is any other thought pattern than the logical. He would try to solve the
problems of psionics by logical methods, and would waste the rest of his
life trying to do the impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The senator stroked his chin. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s clear,&rdquo; he said
at last. &ldquo;Well, it was worth a cracked jaw to save him.
We&rsquo;ve given him a perfectly logical explanation of his rescue and,
simultaneously, we&rsquo;ve put the Chinese government into absolute
confusion. They have no idea of how you got out of there,
Candron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not as important as saving Ch&rsquo;ien,&rdquo;
Candron said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the senator said quickly, &ldquo;of course not. After
all, the Secretary of Research needs Dr. Ch&rsquo;ien&mdash;the
man&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spencer Candron smiled. &ldquo;I agree. He&rsquo;s practically
indispensable&mdash;as much as a man can be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the Secretary&rsquo;s right hand man,&rdquo; said
Taggert firmly.</p>
